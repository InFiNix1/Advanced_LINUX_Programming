Step 1 - Define Fucntions eg. add.c sub.c

Step 2 - Create object file which shall be **POSITION INDEPENDENT**

e.g  ----    $ gcc -fPIC -c add.c

Step 3 - Created The Shared Library and Link all the Objects to the Library 

NOTE- Dynamic Library has .so as extension --- Shared Object(.so)

eg. ------ $ gcc shared -o libbasic.so add.o sub.o

Here lib<library_name> and add.o sub.o are functions names

Step 4 - Create Header File for Fucntion Declaration to main file

eg -- basic.h 

Here <name>.h is name of the header file

Step 5 -- Create actual Executable File from main() 

eg -- demo.c  which has the block of tasks to complete

Step 6 - Compile and create Object File for main()

eg ---- $ gcc -c demo.c 

Step 6 - Create Executable File from Object File of main() and Linking With Library

eg ---- $ gcc -o demo demo.o libbasic.so

Step 7 - Move the Library to /usr/lib with root privileges

Step 8 - Reconfigure or Update Cache of Library 

$ ldconfig
